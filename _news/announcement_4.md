Excited to share that I have joined <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)</a> as a Research Scientist Intern in summer 2024. I will be working with <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/people/nathan-tallent">Nathan Tallent</a> & <a href="http://www.luanzhengguo.com">Luanzheng "Lenny" Guo</a> in the Scalable Computing & Data team within the High Performance Computing (HPC) Group.
